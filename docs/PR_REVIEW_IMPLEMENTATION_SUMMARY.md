## 🔍 Technical Approach

### Current Implementation

Given the current lack of a public GitHub Copilot API for automated reviews, the implementation:

**Uses**:
- ✅ GitHub CLI for PR interaction
- ✅ GitHub Actions for automation
- ✅ Bash scripting for logic
- ✅ Structured markdown templates

**Provides**:
- ✅ Consistent review framework
- ✅ Best practices reminders
- ✅ Actionable recommendations
- ✅ Resource suggestions

**Documents**:
- ✅ Current limitations transparently
- ✅ Alternative approaches available
- ✅ Future integration pathway
- ✅ Workarounds and best practices

### Transparent Limitations

**What It Does** ✅:
- Automatically comments on PRs
- Provides structured review checklist
- Reminds about best practices
- Links to useful resources

**What It Doesn't Do (Yet)** ⚠️:
- Deep AI-powered code analysis
- Specific bug detection with AI
- Context-aware suggestions
- Inline code comments

**Why**:
GitHub Copilot doesn't currently offer a public API for automated PR reviews via GitHub Actions. The implementation provides a solid framework that will be enhanced once the API becomes available.

### Alternative Approaches Documented

1. **GitHub Code Scanning (CodeQL)**
   - Security vulnerability detection
   - Pattern-based analysis
   - Integration example provided

2. **Static Analysis Tools**
   - HTMLProofer for HTML validation
   - Stylelint for CSS standards
   - ESLint for JavaScript quality

3. **Manual Review with Copilot**
   - Use Copilot in IDE during review
   - Copilot Chat for code questions
   - Most effective current approach
