# Automated PR Review with GitHub Copilot

## Overview

This repository uses GitHub Actions to provide automated pull request reviews with **intelligent code quality suggestions**. The workflow analyzes different file types and provides specific, actionable best-practice recommendations based on modern web development standards.

## Key Features

✨ **File-Type Specific Analysis**
- JavaScript: Performance tips, modern practices, memory management
- HTML: Accessibility checks, semantic markup, SEO recommendations
- CSS: Responsive design, modern layouts, accessibility
- Ruby/Jekyll: Template best practices, security considerations
- Configuration files: Security checks, version pinning

🎯 **Severity Levels**
- 🚨 **Error**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Important improvements recommended
- 💡 **Info**: Helpful suggestions for best practices

📚 **Documentation Links**
- Each suggestion includes links to relevant documentation
- Resources from MDN, Web.dev, WCAG, and official tool docs

## How It Works

### Workflow Trigger

The automated review workflow (`.github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml`) is triggered on the following events:
- **opened**: When a new PR is created
- **synchronize**: When new commits are pushed to an existing PR
- **reopened**: When a closed PR is reopened

### Review Process

1. **Checkout Code**: The workflow checks out the repository code
2. **Fetch PR Diff**: Retrieves the changes made in the pull request
3. **Run Code Quality Analyzer**: Analyzes changed files for best practices
   - JavaScript files: Checks for console.log, var usage, equality operators, event handlers
   - HTML files: Validates alt attributes, semantic HTML, accessibility features
   - CSS files: Reviews for modern practices, responsive design, accessibility
   - Ruby/Jekyll files: Checks Liquid templates, URL handling, security
   - YAML/JSON files: Security checks, syntax validation, version pinning
4. **Generate Review**: Creates an automated review with:
   - Summary of changes
   - File modification statistics
   - Specific code quality suggestions with severity levels
   - Documentation links for improvements
5. **Post Comment**: Adds the review as a comment on the PR
6. **Apply Labels**: Optionally adds an `automated-review` label to the PR

### What Gets Reviewed

The automated review analyzes:
- **Code changes in the PR diff** - Only new or modified lines are analyzed
- **File-specific patterns** - Each file type has tailored checks
- **Security concerns** - Hardcoded secrets, XSS vulnerabilities, permission issues
- **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, alt text, motion preferences, semantic HTML
- **Performance** - Lazy loading, DOM queries, CSS optimizations
- **Modern practices** - ES6+ features, Flexbox/Grid, relative units

### Review Content

Each automated review includes:
- 📝 **Summary**: Brief overview with file count and change statistics
- 📊 **Analysis**: Change scope and detection status
- 🔍 **Code Quality Suggestions**: File-specific best-practice recommendations
  - Severity levels (error, warning, info)
  - Category tags (Accessibility, Security, Performance, etc.)
  - Actionable messages explaining the issue
  - Links to relevant documentation
- ⚠️ **Automated Checks**: Breakdown of file types modified
- 🎯 **Next Steps**: Guidance for manual review process

## Permissions

The workflow requires the following permissions:
- `contents: read` - To checkout and read repository code
- `pull-requests: write` - To comment on pull requests
- `issues: write` - To manage PR labels and metadata

## Current Limitations

### Scope of Analysis

✅ **What It Does:**
- Analyzes code changes with pattern-based checks
- Provides actionable, specific suggestions
- Covers JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby/Jekyll, YAML, JSON
- Detects common anti-patterns and security issues
- Maintains consistency across PRs
- Executes quickly (< 30 seconds)

⚠️ **Current Limitations:**
- Pattern-based (not AI-powered semantic analysis)
- Cannot understand complex code logic or context
- May suggest improvements for intentional patterns
- Limited to grep/regex pattern matching
- Cannot detect all edge cases

### Best Practices for Using Suggestions

1. **Review all suggestions** - Automated checks may flag intentional code
2. **Use judgment** - Not all suggestions apply to every situation
3. **Learn from patterns** - Suggestions help identify recurring issues
4. **Prioritize by severity** - Address errors first, then warnings, then info
5. **Follow documentation links** - Understand the reasoning behind suggestions

### Alternative Approaches

For additional code quality checks, consider these complementary tools:

#### 1. **GitHub Code Scanning (CodeQL)**
Deep semantic analysis for security vulnerabilities:
```yaml
# Add to your workflow
- name: Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
  with:
    languages: javascript, html, css

- name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
  uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

#### 2. **GitHub Copilot in IDE**
- Use GitHub Copilot directly in VS Code or other supported IDEs
- Get real-time, context-aware suggestions while reviewing
- More intelligent than pattern-based automation

#### 3. **Linters and Static Analysis**
For this Jekyll site, consider adding:
- **HTMLProofer**: Validate HTML and check for broken links
- **Stylelint**: Enforce CSS coding standards  
- **ESLint**: Check JavaScript code quality

Example workflow addition:
```yaml
- name: Run Linters
  run: |
    npm install -g stylelint eslint
    stylelint "assets/css/**/*.css"
    eslint "assets/js/**/*.js"
```

- name: Install HTMLProofer
  run: gem install html-proofer

- name: Build Jekyll site
  run: bundle exec jekyll build

- name: Test with HTMLProofer
  run: htmlproofer ./_site --disable-external
```

#### 4. **Manual Review with Copilot**
The most effective approach currently:
1. Reviewer opens the PR in their IDE
2. Uses GitHub Copilot Chat to ask questions about the code
3. Gets AI-powered suggestions for improvements
4. Provides informed feedback on the PR

## Configuration

### Workflow Parameters

The PR review workflow can be customized with the following parameters:

#### Manual Trigger Options (workflow_dispatch)

```yaml
# Trigger manually from Actions tab
enable_code_analysis: true/false  # Enable or disable code quality analysis
max_suggestions_per_file: 5       # Maximum number of suggestions per file (1-10)
```

### Automatic Behavior

By default, the workflow:
- ✅ Runs automatically on PR open, sync, and reopen events
- ✅ Analyzes all supported file types in the diff
- ✅ Provides up to 5 suggestions per file
- ✅ Includes all severity levels (error, warning, info)
- ✅ Runs in under 30 seconds for typical PRs

### Performance Optimization

The analyzer is optimized for speed:
- Only analyzes changed lines (not entire files)
- Limits suggestions per file to avoid overwhelming output
- Skips binary files and build artifacts
- Uses efficient bash/grep patterns for pattern matching

## Customization

### Modifying Review Templates

Edit the review template in `.github/workflows/copilot-pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Generate AI Review Summary
  run: |
    cat > review-output.md << 'EOF'
    ## Your Custom Review Template
    ...
    EOF
```

### Adjusting Code Analysis Rules

Edit the analyzer script at `.github/scripts/code-analyzer.sh`:

```bash
# Modify existing checks
if echo "$content" | grep -q "pattern"; then
    add_suggestion "$file" "severity" "Category" "Message" "docs_link"
fi

# Add new checks for your needs
if echo "$content" | grep -q "your-pattern"; then
    add_suggestion "$file" "warning" "Custom Check" "Your message" "https://..."
fi

# Adjust max suggestions per file
MAX_SUGGESTIONS_PER_FILE=10  # Change from default 5
```

### File Type Coverage

To add support for new file types, extend the `analyze_file()` function:

```bash
case "$extension" in
    js)
        analyze_javascript "$file" "$content"
        ;;
    # Add your new file type
    ts|tsx)
        analyze_typescript "$file" "$content"
        ;;
esac
```

Then create the corresponding analyzer function following the existing patterns.

### Adding Repository-Specific Checks

For this portfolio site, you might want to add custom checks:

```bash
# In code-analyzer.sh, add to analyze_html():
# Check for portfolio-specific requirements
if echo "$content" | grep -qE "<a.*github\.com" && ! echo "$content" | grep -qE "target=\"_blank\""; then
    add_suggestion "$file" "info" "External Links" "Open GitHub links in new tabs with target='_blank'" ""
fi
```

### Customizing Triggers

Modify the `on:` section to change when reviews run:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
    branches:
      - main  # Only review PRs to main branch
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'  # Skip documentation-only changes
```
