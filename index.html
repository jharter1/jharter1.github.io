<h1>Welcome to Hartr.net!</h1>

</br>

<h2>What is this for?</h2>

<p>This is the home site of the Jack Harter online presence. It includes a
pitch that serves as an online CV. I will try to update it occasionally, but
I cannot make serious promises about that. Please enjoy.
</p>

</br>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>

<p>I am an information technology professional living in Chicago with
a background in networking, security, open source and containerized solutions.
I'm working to learn more within the Kubernetes, Rancher, Docker and Hashicorp fields.

<p>My nontechnical interests include gardening, new cuisine, homebrew and
board games, as well as spending quality time with my wife, Kari; cat, Louis, and
iguana Gerald.</p>

</br>

<h2>So why should I care, good sir?</h2>

<p>Technology will not be kept in a dusty closet or restricted to the dungeons of the corporate world.
The most successful companies of the recent past and the near future are those who embrace new processes and
tools before their competition can.
The only way this can be ensured is by promoting and utilizing the best new ideas over stuff that just works.</p>

<p>Staying relevant and strong can be a daunting and sometimes scary pursuit.
But with the right combination of application and expertise, we can engage with
the future on our terms rather than those of our competitors.
</p>

</br>

<p><h2>When is the best time to future-proof your interests? </p></h2>

<h3>What will still work tomorrow?</p>

<h3>And where do we start to use it today?</p></h3>

<p>Since 2010, I've worked in environments ranging from two-person
startups to Fortune 100 companies. Whether you want to better protect your
enterprise data, talk about the fun properties of Arch or play an engrossing
game of Magic, I'd love to meet and chat over a beer or coffee.
