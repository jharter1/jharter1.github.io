    <h1>About the author:</h1>
    <p>Jack Harter is a DevOps and Linux engineer working and living
      in Chicago, Illinois. Born in the later 80s and raised in the suburbs,
      he graduated DePaul University with a BA in English Lit. and studied
      social psychology at the  Ibero-American University in Mexico City.</p>
    <p>Since the day he received a hand-me-down PowerBook 170 in 1999,
      Jack has been obsessed with not only what you could do with computers,
      but how machines change the way people work and play. While starting his
      first fiction work in 2004, he taught himself to type ten-fingered, and
      since then has been on a journey of self-development and exploration into
      the world of open-source, networking, project management and enterprise
      implementation.</p>
    <p>The authorâ€™s interests include running, board games, fine beer, wilderness survival and
      woodcraft. He continues to live in Chicago with his wife Kari, cat Louis, and lizard Jerald.</p>
